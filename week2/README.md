# Strings

Every string needs to be terminated somehow.

A string is formed by a sequence of chars followed by a '\0' as a terminator.

Bubble sort

(n-1)+(n-2)+...+1
n(n-1)/2
(n^2)/2-(1/2)

So: O(n^2)

To understand recursive algorithms, write a list on a paper and when a task is completed cross it and go back to the previous step.
